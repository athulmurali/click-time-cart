The Pirate Shop 
The original Star Wars movies have been re-released on DVD and Blu-Ray. Your friend Piratical Liz, who has a boat off the coast in international waters, thinks she can undersell the distributor with cheap knock-off discs. She needs to build an online store to sell the dodgy movies. You are her only friend except for a crab named Gerald, and Gerald's strong sense of ethics has prevented him from taking part in this tomfoolery. The task of building the online store will have to fall to you.

A basic web application that implements a shopping cart. Piratical Liz's store will need to stock the following items:

Star Wars Episode IV DVD ($20)

Star Wars Episode V DVD ($20)

Star Wars Episode VI DVD ($20)

Star Wars Episode IV Blu-Ray ($25)

Star Wars Episode V Blu-Ray ($25)

Star Wars Episode VI Blu-Ray ($25)


When you add an item to the shopping cart, the cart should indicate the total number of items and the total cost. Customers should be able to change the quantity of each item after it has been added. Customers should also be able to remove an item from the cart entirely.


Stretch Goal 1 
If a customer adds all the different DVDs to their cart, they will automatically receive a 10% discount on those items only. If the customer adds all the Blu-Rays to their cart, they will automatically receive a 15% discount on those items only. These discounts should be indicated so the customer can see their savings.


Stretch Goal 2 
Implement a bulk discount, so that if the customer adds 100 items or more to their cart, they will receive a 5% discount on their total. This discount should be applied to the total after the discounts above.


All the goals have been met.

the discount value is configurable.
